|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|3|[README](https://github.com/csc510-fall22-p2-g33/FlashCards#readme)
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|3|[README](https://github.com/csc510-fall22-p2-g33/FlashCards#readme)
